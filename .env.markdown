# Environmental file info

If you're running in production, you should set these securely.

However, if you just want to experiment, set the following values

## Django Settings

These are all Django settings, defined in `history4feed/settings.py`

* `DJANGO_SECRET`: `insecure_django_secret`
* `DJANGO_DEBUG`: `True`
* `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`: BLANK
* `DJANGO_CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS`: `True`
* `DJANGO_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: LEAVE EMPTY

## Postgres Settings

These are all Django settings, defined in `history4feed/settings.py`

* `POSTGRES_HOST`: `pgdb`
* `POSTGRES_PORT`: BLANK
* `POSTGRES_DB`: `postgres`
* `POSTGRES_USER`: `postgres`
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: `postgres`

## Celery settings

* `CELERY_BROKER_CONNECTION_RETRY_ON_STARTUP`: `1`

## history4feed API settings

These define how the API behaves.

* `MAX_PAGE_SIZE`: `50`
	* This is the maximum number of results the API will ever return before pagination
* `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`: `50`
	* The default page size of result returned by the API

## Search Index Mode (Serper)

Search index mode, uses the [Serper API Key](https://serper.dev/) to scrape search results.

* `SERPER_API_KEY`
	* [Get your key here](https://serper.dev/api-key).

## Scrape backfill settings

* `EARLIEST_SEARCH_DATE`: `2020-01-01T00:00:00Z`
	* determines how far history4feed will backfill posts for newly added feeds. e.g. `EARLIEST_SEARCH_DATE=2020-01-01T00:00:00Z` will import all posts with a publish date >= `2020-01-01T00:00:00Z`

## Proxy settings

* `SCRAPFILE_APIKEY`: YOUR_API_KEY
	* We strongly recommend using the [ScrapFly](https://scrapfly.io/) proxy service with history4feed. Though we have no affiliation with them, it is the best proxy service we've tested and thus built in support for it to history4feed.

## Settings to avoid rate limits if not using Scrapfly

If you're not using a Proxy it is very likely you'll run into rate limits on the WayBack Machine and the blogs you're requesting the full text from. You should therefore consider the following options

* `WAYBACK_SLEEP_SECONDS`: `45`
	* This is useful when a large amount of posts are returned. This sets the time between each request to get the full text of the article to reduce servers blocking robotic requests.
* `REQUEST_RETRY_COUNT`: `3`
	* This is useful when a large amount of posts are returned. This sets the number of retries when a non-200 response is returned.
